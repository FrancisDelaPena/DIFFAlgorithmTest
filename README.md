# DIFFAlgorithmTest
A simple app that tests Python 3.4's diff capabilities.  For March 21st-28th stage of Independent Study course.

The app first compares two lines, then two paragraphs, then two pages, all of which are of my choosing.

The only difficulties that I faced were the unicode issues with ASCII when comparing entire pages.  Everything else was easy to figure out.
